## How it works

This project executes an assembly program through the use of a CPU that utilizes a common bus as the sole method of data transfer between resources in the processor. 

## How to test

An external clock should be connected to the clock pin, and an Arduino should be used to actually program the instruction.

## External hardware

- 8 LEDs
- Arduino
- 24 jumper wires
